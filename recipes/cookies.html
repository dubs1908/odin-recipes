      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 premade pie crust</li>
        <li>All purpose flour for dusting</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            Line 2 large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll premade pie crust to 1/8 inch thickness on a lightly floured work surface, 
            and cut using desired cookie cutter shapes</li>
        <li>Transfer cut-outs to prepared baking sheets, leaving about a 1/2-inch space between each cookie. 
            Repeat with remaining dough, rerolling scraps once.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg and milk in a small bowl until combined. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of each cookie evenly with egg mixture; discard remaining egg mixture. Whisk together sugar, cinnamon, and salt 
            in a small bowl until evenly combined, sprinkle evenly over brushed cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies, one baking sheet at a time, in the preheated oven until 
            the edges and bottoms of cookies just become golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and brush tops of each cookie lightly with 
            melted butter, let cool slightly on baking sheet, about 5 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
